title: Auto-Fix Loop
description: How the automatic fix loop works.
---

When a pipeline step finds issues, `no-mistakes` can automatically ask the agent to fix them before pausing for your approval. This is controlled by the `auto_fix` configuration.

  run["Run step"] --> findings{"Findings?"}
  findings -- "no" --> done["Step completes"]
  findings -- "yes" --> eligible{"Auto-fix enabled and eligible findings?"}
  eligible -- "no" --> pause["Pause for user approval"]
  eligible -- "yes" --> fix["Agent applies fixes"]
  fix --> rerun["Re-run step"]
  rerun --> clean{"Blocking findings remain?"}
  clean -- "no" --> done
  clean -- "yes, attempts left" --> eligible
  clean -- "yes, limit hit" --> pause
```

## How it works

1. A step executes and returns findings (e.g., test failures, lint warnings, review issues)
2. If `auto_fix` is enabled for that step (limit > 0) and the attempt count is below the limit, the executor re-runs the step with `fixing=true`
3. The agent receives the previous findings and applies fixes
4. The step re-runs to verify the fixes
5. If issues remain and attempts are left, the loop continues
6. Once the limit is reached or all issues are resolved:
   - If issues remain, the step pauses for user approval
   - If everything passes, the step completes and the pipeline moves on

The lint step has one exception: when `commands.lint` is empty, the agent detects relevant linters and formatters, applies safe fixes, verifies them, and commits any changes during the initial lint pass.
Any unresolved lint findings from that pass pause for approval instead of entering another automatic fix loop.

## Configuration

Set limits in global or repo config:

```yaml
auto_fix:
  rebase: 3
  review: 0    # disabled by default, requires manual approval
  test: 3
  document: 3
  lint: 3
  ci: 3        # shared by CI for failures, and on GitHub/GitLab for merge conflicts
```

Setting a step to `0` disables the follow-up auto-fix loop, so the pipeline pauses for human input when that step finds issues.
For empty `commands.lint`, the initial lint pass can still apply safe fixes before reporting unresolved issues.

`auto_fix.review` defaults to `0`, so review findings require manual approval unless you opt in.

`auto_fix.ci` applies to the CI step. The same limit covers CI-failure fixes for supported providers, plus merge-conflict fixes on GitHub and GitLab.

Repo config overlays global config - you can set `auto_fix.lint: 5` in a repo's `.no-mistakes.yaml` to override just that step while inheriting the rest from global.

## Finding actions

Agent-driven findings now use an `action` field instead of `requires_human_review`:

- `auto-fix` - objective issues that can be fixed automatically
- `ask-user` - intent-sensitive or ambiguous issues that always require manual approval and are never auto-fixed
- `no-op` - informational notes that do not need a fix

`ask-user` is meant for findings that challenge the author's intent - for example, questioning an intentional product or design choice, or arguing that an intentional addition, removal, or guard should be undone. Routine correctness, reliability, or security fixes still stay `auto-fix` even if the smallest fix reintroduces a small amount of previously deleted logic.

The `review`, `test`, and configured-command `lint` steps use this shared model directly. The `document` step also uses the same `action` field, but any documentation finding still pauses for approval because even objective doc gaps need an explicit documentation pass before the pipeline continues.
When `commands.lint` is empty, lint findings describe issues left after the agent already attempted safe fixes, so they pause for approval instead of remaining eligible for another automatic fix loop.

Documentation findings use the same approval loop, but the `document` step treats any finding as a documentation gap that should pause for approval. When auto-fix is enabled, the agent can update docs or doc comments, then the step re-runs and proceeds only after reassessment returns no findings.

## User-triggered fixes

When the pipeline pauses for approval, you can manually trigger a fix from the TUI:

1. The findings panel shows all findings with checkboxes
2. Toggle individual findings with `space`, or use `A` (all) / `N` (none)
3. Optionally press `e` to attach a note to the current finding, or `+` to add your own finding to the fix request
4. Press `f` to fix the selected findings

The agent receives the merged fix payload for that round: the selected agent findings, any per-finding user notes, any selected user-authored findings added from the TUI, and a sanitized history of previous rounds for that step. That history includes which finding IDs were selected for a prior fix attempt, which findings were left unselected by the user, and any one-line summaries from earlier fix commits. On follow-up review passes, that history tells the agent not to re-report user-ignored findings unless the code now presents a materially different issue.

After a user-triggered fix, the step re-runs and pauses again to show you the results (`fix_review` status). You can then approve, fix again, skip, or abort.

## Fix commits

Each auto-fix cycle commits its changes with a descriptive message:

| Step | Commit prefix |
|---|---|
| Rebase | `no-mistakes(rebase): <summary>` |
| Review | `no-mistakes(review): <summary>` |
| Test | `no-mistakes(test): <summary>` |
| Document | `no-mistakes(document): <summary>` |
| Lint | `no-mistakes(lint): <summary>` |

The push step commits any remaining uncommitted changes with `no-mistakes: apply agent fixes`.

## Step rounds

Each execution of a step (initial run or follow-up auto-fix run) is recorded as a "round" in the database. A round stores its findings, duration, any selected finding IDs and whether that selection came from the user or auto-fix filtering, the merged finding payload actually sent to the fix agent for that round, and the one-line fix summary for fix rounds. That merged payload can include per-finding user notes and user-authored findings added from the TUI. The PR body's deterministic risk assessment, testing, and pipeline sections are built from these rounds, giving reviewers visibility into test results, review risk, what was fixed, and how many attempts it took.

Round trigger types:
- `initial` - first execution
- `auto_fix` - triggered by the automatic fix loop
- `auto_fix` - also used when you press `f` in the TUI to run a follow-up fix

Legacy `user_fix` rounds are still rendered as `auto-fix` in PR summaries for backward compatibility.
